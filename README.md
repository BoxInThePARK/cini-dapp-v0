Buliding the next generation film camera.

## Features

- Authorize the web app for use with a native mobile wallet app.
- Record a message of your choosing on-chain, using the Memo program.
- Sign a message of your choosing.
- Request an airdrop of SOL on devnet.

## Prerequisites

1. Set up the Android development environment by following the [environment setup instructions](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) for your OS.
2. Install at least one mobile wallet adapter compliant wallet app on your device/simulator. You can build and install [`fakewallet`](../../android/fakewallet/) for testing purposes.

## Quick Start

### Android

1. Install dependencies and build the client libraries locally with `yarn`.
2. Launch Android Studio and launch a virtual device.
3. Start the React Native packager, build the application, and start the simulator with `yarn android`.

## Development

After making changes to any of the client libraries in `js/packages/` you will need to re-run `yarn` in this directory. This will rebuild the client libraries and copy their build artifacts into the `node_modules/` folder of this example app.

### Add new fonts

Add in font file into `assets/fonts` and run `yarn link-asset`. This will compile the fonts into both iOS and Android. For more information, check out [this article](https://mehrankhandev.medium.com/ultimate-guide-to-use-custom-fonts-in-react-native-77fcdf859cf4).
