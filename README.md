## Getting Started

### Android

1. Install dependencies and build the client libraries locally with `yarn`.

2. Launch Android Studio and launch a virtual device.

3. Start the React Native packager, build the application, and start the simulator with `yarn android`.

## Development

After making changes to any of the client libraries in `js/packages/` you will need to re-run `yarn` in this directory. This will rebuild the client libraries and copy their build artifacts into the `node_modules/` folder of this example app.

### Add new fonts

Add in font file into `assets/fonts` and run `yarn link-asset`. This will compile the fonts into both iOS and Android. For more information, check out [this article](https://mehrankhandev.medium.com/ultimate-guide-to-use-custom-fonts-in-react-native-77fcdf859cf4).
